# Munich AirBnb Data Analysis

This project deals with the AirBnB market in Munich. It is part of my Data Science Nanodegree Program.

## Objectives
This project aims to get a better understanding of the AirBnB market in Munich.
Therefore I'll try to find answers to the following four questions:

1. Which time is the most expensive / cheapest to travel to Munich?

2. Is making a booking at a certain time of the year more expensive than during the rest of the year?

3. Is it possible to build a model to automatically suggest a price to hosts?

4. Which factors influence the price most and how do they influence it?

## Installation
Python3 needs to be installed.
All dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them just use pip install requirements.txt. The most important libraries used in this project are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn
* shap

You can use the data available in the repo or use the data_extraction.py script to download all data files from the website Inside AirBnB.
